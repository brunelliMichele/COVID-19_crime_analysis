% Data Description
This section describes the data used for the analysis presented above. Official statistics on reported crimes were obtained by querying the SDMX APIs exposed via web services by ISTAT. SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange) is a standard widely adopted by statistical institutions to provide access to time series in a standardized and reproducible manner.

Data on crime rates are normilized per 100k inhabitants, and made available by ISTAT in several formats. For convenience, the data were downloaded in CSV format and subsequently aggregated---one dataset per year---into a single Parquet file. Parquet is a binary, columnar, and typed data format. This structure allows access to only the relevant columns without scanning the entire file each time, thereby minimizing input/output operations. Parquet is widely used in data analysis because it maximizes performance while minimizing both memory usage and storage requirements. Although the CSV files are described as containing annual data, they include observations for both the reference year and the subsequent year. For this reason, a consistency check was performed on the aggregated Parquet file in order to avoid duplicated values.

For map creation, ISTAT dataset were merged with geographic data provided by Eurostat GISCO. Eurostat supplies geometries in GEOJSON format, organized by territorial levels. The levels used in this analysis are NUTS1 (macro-areas), NUTS2 (regions), and NUTS3 (provinces). ISTAT data rely on the 2006 version of the NUTS classification. As a result, it was necessary to manually map provinces that underwent administrative changes after 2006, most notably in Sardinia.

The data were aggregated into three time periods. The first corresponds to the pre-pandemic period (2014--2019) and reports the six-year average in order to obtain a robust baseline. The second period covers the years of acute pandemic impact (2020--2021) and reports their average. The third corresponds to the post-pandemic recovery phase and reports the average for the subsequent two years (2022--2023).

As mentioned above, the spatial analysis was conducted at three nested geographic levels. The macro level considers five areas of the Italian peninsula: North-East, North-West, Centre, South, and Islands. The meso level corresponds to regions, while the micro level corresponds to provinces.

The dataset containing crime rates classify offenses into 55 categories. Although the analytical pipeline and the web-based platform process all crime categories provided by ISTAT, the results discussed in this report focus on a subset of categories that are most relevant to the research question, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:crime_categories}. Crime categories were grouped based on the predominant modality of interaction involved in the offense, distinguishing between crimes requiring direct physical contact (\emph{contact crimes}) and crimes primarily mediated by digital infrastructures (\emph{digital crimes}). Based on changes in daily routines induced by the pandemic, a decrease in contact crimes is expected during the second analyzed period, while an increase in digital crimes is anticipated.

The use of the global Moran's $I$ index allows for the assessment of spatial autocorrelation in crime rates. In particular, it is expected that some crimes exhibit structured spatial patterns during the pre-pandemic period, whereas these patterns may weaken or change during the pandemic as a consequence of mobility restrictions. Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) are used to identify local clusters and spatial outliers. The analysis aims to assess whether the pandemic altered the spatial distribution of crime clusters, especially for contact and digital crimes, highlighting potential processes of territorial concentration or dispersion.
